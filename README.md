_Note: The first algorithm exits once an iteration is passed without any swaps made, signalling that the array is completely sorted. The second algorithm iterates the maximum possible number times (array.length - 1) before exiting. While both methods are suitable for the purposes of this project, it should be noted the first method is better practice in that it does not run code unnecessarily._
