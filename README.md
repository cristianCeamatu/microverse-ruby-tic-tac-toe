# Bubble Sort

> For this project, we created two **sorting algorithms** that use the [bubble sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort) method. 

This side-by-side comparative method is seen in the GIF image below.

> The second bubble sort method sorts an array of strings by the length of each element using the "yield" keyword and a code block.

*Note: The first algorithm exits once an iteration is passed without any swaps made, signalling that the array is completely sorted. The second algorithm iterates the maximum possible number times (array.length - 1) before exiting. While both methods are suitable for the purposes of this project, it should be noted the first method is better practice in that it does not run code unnecessarily.*

## Built With
- Ruby
- VSCode
- Rubocop

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To get this project up and running, you must already have ruby installed on your computer.

### Installation

**To get this project set up on your local machine, follow these simple steps:**

1. Open Terminal.

2. Navigate to your desired location to download the contents of this repository.

3. Copy and paste the following code into the Terminal:

    git clone https://github.com/cristianCeamatu/microverse-bubble-sort.git

4. Hit enter.

5. Once the repository has been cloned, navigate inside the repository and type:

    ruby main.rb
    
    This will run the code, printing the output of our tests to the terminal.
